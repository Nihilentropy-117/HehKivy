Voice patterns are influenced by both physiology and socialization. While differences in voice pitch between men and women can be partially explained by physiology, social factors play a significant role. Even though the vocal tracts of four-year-old boys and girls are physiologically similar and their sizes are the same, societal norms lead girls to raise their voices and boys to lower theirs. This early socialization results in distinguishable voice patterns between young boys and girls despite no physiological variance.
