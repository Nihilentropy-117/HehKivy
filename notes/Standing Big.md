Drawing from animal behavior, one can adopt the strategy of acting and appearing big to ward off potential threats, similar to how predators deter stalking. This approach can be applied to human interactions, such as standing firm in business meetings when facing deceit. The notion that everyone, regardless of intelligence or status, is human with emotions and vulnerabilities, supports the application of animal behavior principles to human behavior.
