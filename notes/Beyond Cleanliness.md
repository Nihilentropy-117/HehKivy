Cleanliness, accuracy, and efficiency are often considered important qualities. However, their relative importance can vary. In this discussion, we’ll explore the significance of these qualities and argue that cleanliness may not be as essential as accuracy and efficiency. Cleanliness is often highly valued, akin to godliness. However, this notion might not hold true when compared to the impacts of accuracy and efficiency. While cleanliness is crucial for personal hygiene and maintaining a clean environment, its impact on the world is relatively minimal.

For instance, consider this: if someone forgets to take a shower for a day, the consequences are usually mild. At most, someone might be briefly offended; on average, however, no one even notices. Similarly, if every adult in a country like the United States skipped showering for a day, the world would not undergo significant changes. The impact would be limited to some confusion in water treatment plants and perhaps a slightly uncomfortable bus ride here and there. Even if everyone in the entire world neglected to clean their dishes for a day, the global impact would be minimal.

It’s important to note that while cleanliness becomes a serious problem at some point, it often takes several instances of neglect for this change to occur. Therefore, cleanliness falls behind accuracy and efficiency in terms of importance. Accuracy and efficiency, on the other hand, have a greater impact on the world. A single lie, accidental omission, or small error in mathematics can quickly escalate and cause significant trouble.

Inaccurate information, whether intentional or not, can be highly dangerous. It leads to misunderstandings, misjudgments, and even dire consequences. For instance, in the medical field, accuracy is critical; a small error can mean the difference between life and death. Efficiency, too, plays a crucial role. Being efficient ensures that tasks are completed in a timely manner, resources are used optimally, and productivity is maximized. In the business world, for example, efficiency can lead to better outcomes and higher profits.

While cleanliness is important for personal well-being and maintaining a clean environment, it is not as crucial as accuracy and efficiency. The impact of cleanliness on the world is relatively minimal, whereas accuracy and efficiency have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, prioritizing accuracy and efficiency over cleanliness is essential.

Philosophical studies, such as those [by Kevin Patrick Tobia](https://philpapers.org/rec/TOBCIN), have explored the relationship between cleanliness and morality. The idea that physical cleanliness is linked to moral purity is a recurring theme in philosophical discourse. This delves into the symbolism of cleanliness beyond practical implication, suggesting a deeper moral and psychological impact​
