The Theory of Relative Deprivation, pioneered by Stouffer, has become a fundamental concept in social psychology. This theory posits that an individual's happiness is not determined solely by their objective circumstances, but rather by an invisible frame of reference that they carry in their mind. This frame of reference, often operating at a subconscious level, filters one's experience of the world and shapes their emotional state.

While absolute deprivation, such as extreme poverty or lack of resources, undoubtedly plays a role in one's well-being, research has consistently shown that relative deprivation is even more influential in shaping how individuals perceive and experience their lives. People constantly engage in social comparisons, evaluating their success, relationships, family dynamics, and wealth in relation to those around them.

To truly understand the human, it is crucial to identify and comprehend the frames of reference that individuals employ. These invisible benchmarks serve as the lens through which people interpret their reality and form their sense of contentment or dissatisfaction. By recognizing the power of relative deprivation, we gain insight into the complex interplay between objective conditions and subjective perceptions that define the human experience.
