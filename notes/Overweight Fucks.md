In this discussion, we will explore the distinction between overweight individuals and fat fucks. While both categories involve individuals who weigh more than they should, there are important differences in attitudes and behaviors.

Overweight individuals are those who simply weigh more than they should. There is no specific upper limit to define this category. It can be caused by various factors such as overeating or medical conditions like thyroid problems. While there may be a vague disapproval of willingly harming oneself through unhealthy eating habits, there is generally no issue with these individuals. Their choices are their own, and if they choose to indulge in unhealthy foods, it is their personal decision.

On the other hand, fat fucks represent a distinct category of aggressively overweight individuals. They exhibit certain behaviors and attitudes that set them apart from jolly fat people or those with legitimate medical reasons for their weight.

The earliest signs of a fat fuck in the making can be observed in their insistence on using disability scooters at grocery stores, even when there is no real need for them. This behavior stems from an unwillingness to exert effort and carry their own weight, even if they are only slightly overweight at this point.

The next stage in the journey towards fat fuckhood is marked by the excessive consumption of fast food and snack foods, often to the exclusion of healthier options. Not only do they consume these foods, but they also take pride in their style of eating. Whether this is a coping mechanism or genuine feelings may vary from person to person, but it is a notable characteristic.

After some time, fat fucks may reach the stage of being old fat fucks. Without access to good healthcare, many may succumb to the consequences of their unhealthy lifestyle. However, those who survive tend to double down on their belief in a vegetable-free diet. Years of being a fat fuck have given them confidence in their position, but it has also made them miserable and unpleasant to be around.

Little is known about the twilight years of fat fuckdom, as few individuals seem to live beyond this stage. However, it is possible that there may be exceptions, with some fat fucks living to be a hundred or more. It raises questions about whether their essence shrivels away or if they find redemption on their deathbed. Further research would be necessary to explore this topic in more depth.

In conclusion, there are distinct categories of individuals when it comes to weight-related issues. While overweight individuals may simply weigh more than they should, fat fucks exhibit specific behaviors and attitudes that set them apart. It is important to differentiate between these two groups and avoid generalizations.
