I would argue that it’s often easier to cook something challenging than something simple when cooking for other people. It might sound counterintuitive, but I’d argue that, more often than not, this holds true. Take, for instance, the comparison between cooking a chicken carbonara or a puttanesca pasta dish and preparing a classic BLT sandwich or a traditionally dressed American hamburger. On the surface, it may seem like the latter pair should be a breeze, but there’s more to it.

One key factor at play here is nostalgia. When cooking something intricate, you don’t typically encounter the same roadblocks of nostalgia as you do with simpler fare. Our culinary preferences are often deeply rooted in our past experiences, particularly those from our formative years. When it comes to dishes like hamburgers, people’s taste preferences are intrinsically tied to their memories. It could be the brand of bun they enjoyed in their youth, the way their parents seasoned the hamburger patties, or even the type of grill their family owned. These factors become an integral part of their taste memory, making it almost impossible to recreate someone’s perfect hamburger without having experienced those variables as a child.

Another aspect to consider is the level of customization available when preparing different dishes. With traditionally dressed hamburgers, you don’t have a wide range of knobs to turn to adjust the flavor profile. Sure, you can vary the thickness and seasoning of the beef, and you might experiment with different types of cheese or bun brands and styles. However, beyond these limited options, there’s not much else you can do to create a unique culinary experience.

In contrast, dishes like chicken carbonara or puttanesca offer a more versatile canvas. You can play with various ingredients, spices, and techniques, giving you greater control over the final outcome. This flexibility can make the cooking process feel less daunting and more enjoyable. Interestingly, despite these constraints and the strong ties to nostalgia, many people still hold strong opinions about hamburgers. While they may have limited options for customization, they are passionate about their preferences. This passion can make discussions about the perfect burger surprisingly heated.

On the other hand, when faced with a dish that wasn’t an integral part of their upbringing, like pasta puttanesca, most people have fewer strong opinions. They may have preferences, but they are often more willing to set them aside in favor of savoring the experience of high-quality food. This is except, of course, for those for whom pasta puttanesca was a childhood staple (in which case, this doesn’t apply, and we should find another example).
