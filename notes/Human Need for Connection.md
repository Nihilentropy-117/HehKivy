Everyone is born with the need, the absolute non-negotiable _need_ for comfort, validation, affirmation, emotional regulation, close 1:1 connection, etc. We are biologically wired to expect this from a parental caregiver who is 100% devoted to us with zero expectation for anything in return.

If we don't get them, we will feel constantly dis-regulated and search for them in anything and everyone. Sex can check a lot of those boxes, so it's IMO one of the more common ways to cope with attachment issues.

Our results clarified the well-known relationship between ADHD and hypersexuality, suggesting a significant mediating role of psychotic prodromes and depression in this association. This finding further reinforces the view of hypersexual symptomatology not as a disorder but rather as a psychopathological manifestation of distress, a maladaptive coping strategy that individuals enact due to increased difficulties experienced in the environment.

I feel like that's why the rejection hits twice as hard too. Not only is it "oh you're not in the mood right now" which would normally be fine in a healthy sexual relationship it's "why not, and what did I do wrong" and then the physical symptoms for me personally are sometimes outrageous where even I in my body can sense the overreaction. I have to be with people that are as weird about sex as I am.
