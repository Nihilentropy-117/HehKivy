Opening doors for women is a social practice that has been observed for many years. While some people view it as a gesture of courtesy and chivalry, others find it demeaning and infantilizing. In this discussion, we will explore the different perspectives surrounding this practice and the importance of understanding intent.

Intent plays a significant role in understanding the meaning behind men opening doors for women. Some individuals genuinely believe in the principles of chivalry or have a sense of responsibility to perform such acts of courtesy. For them, it is a way to show respect and care towards women. It is important not to judge these individuals without knowing their intentions.

There are three possible motivations behind men opening doors for women. The first is rooted in a sense of chivalry and a belief that it is a man's responsibility to perform such acts. If this dynamic exists within a relationship and both parties are content, then it is a personal choice that should be respected.

The second possibility is that some individuals may open doors for women intentionally to assert dominance or to degrade them. This behavior is disrespectful and should not be tolerated.

The third possibility is that opening doors for women can be seen as a display of power and control. It can be viewed as demeaning and infantilizing, similar to the hypothetical scenario of cutting a woman's steak into bite-sized pieces. Society has normalized door-opening but not other acts that could be considered equally or more unusual.
