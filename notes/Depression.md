Depression is almost always justifiable, mood disorders don't develop because of "spontaneous irrationality". Psych grad here, I'd hope this is something our mental health practitioners are cognizant of - that mental health disorders are generally the result of a confluence of variables - but I'll use the social anxiety example;

A kid is raised in a household where their single parent is temperamental, doesn't explain rules and tends to get angry for transgressions the kid doesn't understand. The kid has to learn how to avoid these transgressions, this comes in a few forms, first is enhanced ability to detect disapproval, second is anticipating other peoples thoughts and taking preemptive actions, third is turning the blame inwards and looking for flaws in the self. The kid goes off to school and lacks self confidence, they get further ostracized by their peers and further look inwards, become self critical. As an adult this person ends up socially anxious, they have a pattern of learnt behavior where in every social interaction they assume the other person is negatively evaluating them, and they assume they themselves have a flaw which is being examined. In the extreme this can lead to isolation and avoidance of even mundane things like speaking to a register worker at the supermarket.

Is the social anxiety justified? Absolutely. It relates to over a decade of formative, conditioned learning from a parental figure. Removed from this environment, a psychologist may work through their disorder and try to alleviate some of the cognitive distortions, because assuming everyone is negatively evaluating may not necessarily be true. However it's worth noting that like this example, very real environments and conditions bring about these issues, depression is no different. You can't treat a disorder effectively without first removing one from the environment, or alleviating the conditions that brought it about. Sometimes this can be as simple as a poor belief system which has caused you to negatively ruminate after a bad breakup, sometimes it can be an underlying condition like ADHD, ASD, schizophrenia which is severely impairing your life, sometimes it's something like abject poverty and economic turmoil which is bringing on severe depressive episodes in bipolar and throwing you into addiction.

Even when something like depression or anxiety seems to come about "spontaneously" or "irrationally", you'll find it'll relate to something like thyroiditis, chronic sleep deprivation and vitamin deficiencies (IE, D3, magnesium or B12), etc.1694153143
