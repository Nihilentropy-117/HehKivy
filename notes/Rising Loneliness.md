In the 21st century, the success of large corporations depends not only on their physical infrastructure and tangible assets but also on the invisible emotional structures that permeate the organization. These intangible elements, akin to the wiring that powers a building, play a crucial role in determining the overall performance and well-being of the company.

Traditionally, certain emotional norms and behaviors, such as openly discussing feelings, crying at work, and readily admitting mistakes, have been associated with feminine traits. However, the notion that adopting these "girly" norms is necessary for success in the modern business world is a misguided oversimplification.

While it is true that men in some successful organizations have embraced these emotional norms, it is not accurate to label them as inherently feminine. Instead, this shift in behavior represents a broader change in how individuals express themselves and interact with others in the workplace.

Art Kleiner, a renowned author who has extensively studied corporations over the past three decades, argues that attributing this change to gender norms is a superficial interpretation. He asserts that the transformation occurring in these men is not a matter of becoming more feminine but rather a process of opening up and becoming more authentic versions of themselves.

This newfound emotional intelligence and vulnerability allow individuals to foster deeper connections, build trust, and create a more supportive and collaborative work environment. By breaking free from traditional gender stereotypes and embracing a more holistic approach to communication and interaction, organizations can tap into the full potential of their human capital.


 A few new studies have come out that have shown that young men are more lonely and single than ever before. But it's not just men, the women and children too. It's predicted 45% of women will be single and childless by 2030. Research shows that people from individualist countries show a greater sense of loneliness. This is linked to socioeconomic development, increased education, a shift towards white-collar jobs and urbanization. According to Vox, Americans are currently in a "friendship recession" and men are being hit the hardest. The percentage of men who reported having at least six close friendships fell in half since the 90s. One in five men say they have no close friendships. Looking at all these statistics, the explosion of figures like Andrew Tate is not surprising at all.

Studies have shown that men are scared to be vulnerable even around the homies. And can you blame them when the media says stupid shit like this? Fellas, is it woke to open up to your fellow men and discuss history? Men are socialized to believe strength, dominance, and stoicism are behaviors of a real man. Is it any surprise that men are lonely and have fewer friends nowadays? You have to be vulnerable to make friends. Don't tell me there aren't systemic problems affecting men now. While a lot of this may be true, men have been socialized this way for centuries and this is all relatively a new phenomena. Toxic masculinity has existed forever. If anything, there's less toxic masculinity nowadays - the cultural embrace of like gender non-conformity, femme boys, Harry Styles in a dress, Barbie movie, blah blah blah. 

My point is toxic masculinity did not just appear in the mid-2010s, but social media did, and the internet did, and the rise of dating apps did, and the housing crisis and living in a country where the wealth inequality is worse than it was during the Gilded Age - that all happened recently. People are working harder and longer while wages have been stagnant. Men have been dropping out of college like flies, and what does that get you? Poor men, which since women are doing amazing in college now and many are now out-earning men, this most of the time leads to single men, which then leads to lonely men, which leads to depressed men, which leads to the high suicide rate. 

In my opinion, leftism at a policy level does a great job addressing the shitty material conditions that in part lead to the problems that men are facing, but then absolutely drops the ball when it comes to everything and anything related to men's cultural issues. The right is saying to men "you will own a house, you will have beautiful children with your loving wife, you will have privacy, you will have free speech, you will own things and you will be happy," and the left is like "they like having all of the stuff they don't deserve." 

Did we fail men? Don't want to be lectured about the patriarchy, they don't want to be told it's all their fault, they don't want to be told they're part of the problem because first of all, they're not. The average 20-year-old didn't build society. They go to work, come home, watch porn and go to bed like everyone else. A lot of men's value comes from the money they make. Men are natural providers and if they have nobody to provide for they get into fin dom or send random girls on the internet money.  the fact is a lot of men simply feel like they don't have a purpose anymore, whether a job or a career that's fulfilling and pays well, or a woman or family to protect and take care of and provide for. Men are lacking purpose, and a man will crawl through a broken glass for a purpose.
