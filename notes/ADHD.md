Articulating to non-ADHD'ers what I struggle with. Starting. Stopping. Emotional regulation. And the fourth non-biochemically-induced one - Guilt. And doing so in a way that neither puts me down, asks their forgiveness, takes dignity or anything else away from me, or requires them to learn a lot of new things. Life became much better after I was able to do this.

The skill of **seeing other people**. Very hard when my brain has so much to think about. Noticing when they want to say something, or to talk about the thing that matters to them more than about the thing that matters to me. With the layered on skill of consciously allowing this to happen.

Empathy skills. I had to intellectualise it, understand it and *learn* it. I think I may have been a bit of an awful human before I did.

Meditation skills. The skills required to observe what's going on in my brain from a distance, take notice of it when this happens - the appearance and disappearance of thoughts and sensations, without judgement, and distance myself from that mayhem.

Leadership skills. It's one thing for an ADHD brain to figure out something others around us haven't. It's a whole different things to attract others to join up and go achieve it, particularly without the use of carrots and sticks. Turns out our brains are uniquely suited to do this. We can get very high level, if we pump enough perk points into those human seeing skills.

A huge part of it is being able to name our emotions, and communicate them without “becoming them”. My mum did a nice exercise with me once - she had me write down all the emotions I had a name for. After I did (most adults will come up with a list of 20-40 of them), she told me to look at my 3yo daughter wand acknowledge that while she may be small, she feels all of those, and she has no idea what’s going on or names for them. It’s from there we started teaching “Dad, I feel sad, please help me” at three, and always ensuring she gets empathy and hugs. We normalized talking about her inside world.Seeing people starts from understanding a little bit about what goes on inside a person, and it starts there. Brene brown has a great book about it, it’s called “atlas of the heart”. 

Seeing people isn’t just happening at an interpersonal level by the way, is the hottest topic on the planet. #metoo was about it. BLM was about it. The neurodiversity conversation is about it. The war in Ukraine is about it. Everything boils down to one or more groups of people asking to be seen, and the difficulty of their experience acknowledged. 
Acknowledging there’s an element of guilt here that we need to get past, I basically view this weak innate out of the box ability to assess other people’s social or emotional predisposition as a starting point, an attribute of the hardware I run on, but not what determines **if** I am able to do something, only something that shapes **how** I need to go do it. 

In the movie Mad Max: Fury Road, Furiosa, despite having one arm, still uses a sniper rifle. She just does it differently, in a clever way that works given her missing arm. This apples to us too.
Our innate ability to see people is **not meant** to be like (read: as good as, out of the box) as other people’s. Best simply not to pass judgement on it at all. It's not good. It’s not bad. It just is. I got an airplane. Other people got a sailboat. It doesn’t need to be judged. It just is.
Now, because I got an airplane, a piloting handbook for sailboats won’t help me get where I need to go. Airplanes need to be operated differently to reach a desired destination.


Driving this brain that isn’t crash hot at recognizing other people’s predispositions means working out _alternative_ ways to figure out how to notice what’s going on inside people. And the big take home message is that the piloting skill I had to learn here, I had to learn from other people in an airplane, not someone in sailboat saying why don’t you just <do the easy thing from them that’s impossible for me>. Had to go to people who found the ADHD workarounds and learn those. And when I did, I could do this just as well, in these alternative ways that were figured out by our tribe.

Fun facts from a training neuroscientist; you have less available dopamine. We believe this is from having more dopamine transporters removing it from parts of the system we need it in- it leads to increased need for hyperstimulation to achieve focus, and is why stimulants increasing dopamine seem to work best we can tell, but what we don't talk about is another condition that is the loss of dopamine; Parkinson's Disease. A sibling condition, but almost like the inverse, because unlike them, we don't lose it as we age- we never really HAD dopamine much to begin with, and that was a constant.

So we're sent out into the world as basically the physiological equivalent of those waggly balloon men outside used car yards, because dopamine regulates movement inhibition in the somatosensory regions of the brain. Basically, the process to enable you to move your body forwards one meter, then stop exactly. Dopamine makes it hard to stop a movement, or prevent involuntary movements such as tremors. So, we're sort of like a Parkinson's patient! Except instead of losing coordination, we've just learned to operate this clumsy body with style!

But depending on the severity, it also means that clumsiness is incredibly inherent and unavoidable. You're not clumsy; you literally just lack the chemicals to stop restless leg syndrome or even realize it's happening, to adjust your body in microscopic ways of poise and hold yourself in a way to match your proprioception, your 'mental view of self vs surroundings', and your body just doesn't quite fully align to that- so, you crash into stuff.

It's why we often have very shaky hands and struggle with fine detail tasks. ADHD has a full compliment of depressive and physiological effects that it's so weird everyone ignores, and pretending those aren't massive factors in our productivity means they can just ignore ADHD as 'whacky hyper child disorder' rather than suffering a unique form of depression that leads to incredibly comorbid bipolar and extreme difficulties with muscular regulation that impact us in both physical tasks as well as mental. Everyone just treats you as kind of fuckin' useless, when really, you avoid physical activity because of negative feedback for clumsiness, mental activity because of negative feedback due to forgetfulness/focal issues, and social due to depressive spirals.

And nobody tells you that all this shit can get worse as you age. 

### Sensory Processing Sensitivity

People with ADHD often have heightened sensitivity to their environment. This can include sensitivity to noises, textures, lights, or even the emotional climate of a room. This heightened sensory input can be overwhelming and exhausting, affecting concentration, emotional regulation, and physical comfort.

### Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)

RSD is a condition often linked with ADHD, characterized by extreme emotional sensitivity and pain triggered by the perception of rejection or failure. It can lead to significant social anxiety and avoidance behaviors, as individuals with ADHD might go to great lengths to avoid situations where rejection or criticism is possible.

### Sleep Disturbances

Many individuals with ADHD experience difficulties with sleep. This can range from trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, to having a non-restorative sleep. The restless mind of ADHD can make it hard to shut down and rest, contributing to a cycle of fatigue that exacerbates other ADHD symptoms.

### Time Blindness

Time blindness refers to the difficulty in estimating how long tasks will take, remembering deadlines, or managing time effectively. This is not simply poor time management but a fundamental difference in how time is perceived and experienced, often leading to procrastination, last-minute rushes, and stress.

### Emotional Hyperarousal

Apart from RSD, many with ADHD experience intense emotions more broadly. They can have passionate and quick responses to situations, leading to feelings that seem more extreme than those without ADHD might experience. This emotional intensity is not limited to negative emotions; positive experiences can also feel more profound.
