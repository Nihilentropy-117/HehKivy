A truly fascinating thing to observe is humans and their ability and desire to segregate, to create in groups and out groups, [[tribalism]] at its finest. But that possibly is one of the secrets to understanding the human experience and interacting with the people, that human beings want to see the world as a [[Zero-Sum Game]]. It isn't, of course, but that's how we are predisposed to operate. 

In today's rapidly changing and interconnected world, the fundamental human need for belonging and identity remains as strong as ever. People, especially young individuals, are searching for a sense of purpose, recognition, and a place where they feel accepted and valued.

This deep-seated yearning can manifest in various ways, some positive and others destructive. On one hand, individuals may find their identity and sense of belonging through shared interests, hobbies, or communities. They may congregate in coffee shops, ordering from the same menu as everyone else, feeling a part of something larger than themselves. This connection, even if seemingly superficial, can provide a sense of comfort and normalcy in an often chaotic world.

On the other hand, the quest for identity and belonging can also lead people down darker paths. Some may be drawn to extremist ideologies or groups that offer a clear-cut narrative, a sense of brotherhood, and a promise of meaning in a world that often feels meaningless. These individuals may find solace in the words of charismatic figures who preach hatred and division, their message amplified through the echo chambers of social media.

The allure of these extremist groups lies in their ability to provide a strong sense of identity, purpose, and recognition to those who feel lost or marginalized. They offer a clear "us vs. them" mentality, creating a sense of belonging that can be intoxicating to those who **have** never experienced it before.

Human social bonds can form and strengthen through a wide array of interactions and shared experiences. While we often focus on how positive experiences like shared joys, triumphs, and affection bring people together, there is a darker side to social bonding that is equally powerful, if less openly acknowledged. 

Shared negativity towards a third party can be a potent social glue. When two or more people jointly express criticism, mockery, or aggression towards an "outsider," it creates a sense of unity and common identity among them, even in the absence of other meaningful connections. By defining themselves in opposition to a scapegoat, people affirm their belonging to the "in-group."

This dynamic plays out in many contexts, from school yard bullying, to cliques and exclusionary social groups, to even workplace politics and dynamics between colleagues. The primary goal in such interactions is not necessarily to harm the target, though that may be a side effect. Rather, it is to establish and reinforce a social bond among those engaging in the negative behavior. 

At the individual level, this can provide a sense of belonging and shared identity. But from an ethical perspective, it is a toxic way to achieve those aims. It perpetuates cycles of cruelty and ostracization and erodes the overall empathy and compassion within groups and societies.

We want to operate as if there are as few variables as possible and those that do exist are clearly defined. So, given that, the secret to creating bonds and generating peace between people is to create closed loops, to create closed systems. We do this by finding commonalities. It's harder to dislike someone if they also like the same football team. We also do this by our jobs, by our hobbies, by our places of recreation.

Given the choice, most people would side automatically with the stranger that they see sometimes on the weekends at the same bar they go to versus someone they've never seen before, regardless of the fact that there's no logistical difference in the process. We want to draw circles. We want to define people as our people or not our people. And once we've done that, we react, sometimes violently, to protect or reject people based on these preconceived groupings, which are quite often, more often than not, pointless in nature.

When you raise the idea of death in someone's mind, which can be done experimentally by simply asking a question like, "What do you think happens to you physically as you're dying and once you're dead?", it has an interesting effect on how they view others.

People tend to rate those in their own group more favorably when they're thinking about death compared to when they're not. In experiments, people were asked to rate traits like honesty, kindness, and intelligence. The results showed that Christians liked Christians better, Italians liked Italians better, and even Germans, who are usually fairly neutral about other Germans (possibly due to lingering guilt), suddenly liked Germans much more when contemplating their own mortality. It's as if interviewing Germans in a funeral home makes them more nationalistic.

But it's not just that we like our own group more when faced with thoughts of death. The reverse is also true: we tend to view those outside our group more negatively. People become more hostile towards other cultures.

So why might we react this way? According to terror management theory, it's a strange way we try to fend off death anxiety. The idea is that people who are different from us, who don't share our language, values, or beliefs, in some primal way, it's like they can't really see or validate our worldview. And when our mortality is made salient, we cling more tightly to that worldview and those who share it, while pushing away those who threaten it.
