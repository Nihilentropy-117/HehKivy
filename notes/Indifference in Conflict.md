The concept of reciprocal hostility arises when an individual or group feels deeply wronged by systemic injustice and oppression, such as racism, often perpetuated by those in positions of power like politicians. In response to being branded with a hostile label like "terrorist," the aggrieved party may react by embodying that very label - "You think I'm a terrorist? I'll show you a terrorist." 

This reflects the psychological principle of complementarity, where hostility begets hostility in a self-perpetuating cycle. When one side lashes out, verbally or physically, the other side often feels compelled to respond in kind. Aggression is met with aggression as each side mirrors the other's animosity.

At the heart of this dynamic is a desire for revenge, to give back what one has received. The oppressed yearn to turn the tables on their oppressors and make them experience the same pain and degradation. By becoming the "terrorist" they've been unjustly painted as, they aim to strike fear in those who have subjugated them.

However, this reciprocity ultimately breeds more destruction and division rather than justice or resolution. It escalates conflicts and hardens resentments on both sides. The original wounds of racism and inequity remain unhealed, compounded now by new layers of retributive violence. 

We far too often accept the status quo narrative without question and allow atrocities to occur if the conditions are present. And when I speak of institutions, I speak of government, religion, and corporate/financial institutions. We put faith in them without holding them accountable. And one of the solutions I propose is mandating accountability within the institutions.Thankfully the US has oversight committees but they lack strong personal/individual accountability and legal rigor.

It’s because powerful institutions almost always will try to control a narrative from as many fronts as possible.Thankfully the internet has been able to allow us to globally express our shared humanity across all borders and I am witnessing a genocide being recorded from several civilians cell phones. Most people are too prideful to question institutions that often allow us to de-humanize our neighbor or some poor guy in his country defending a foriegn invader. I am witnessing IDF conduct revenge killings in the same manner ISIS was. It’s wild most people are oblivious to the reality and my deep question of HOW brought me to the realization of blind faith in institutions that dominate the narrative on repeat. We put far too much faith in institutions that have long divided us. We are at a cross roads as a species in our evolution where we must transcend our effort towards interstellar travel. War is so obsolete, that we will go extinct, and erase ourselves from this planet if it persists. Especially with the advancement of our technologies and nuclear weapons, which I lose sleep over and wake up with anxiety over every day. I don’t feel comfortable bringing children into this earth with war, nukes, ww2, and what I’ve seen Israel (the very people I least expected) doing a ‘soft’ genocide while nobody bats an eye.
