This project aims to explore the idea that there are constructs within society that people are only partially aware of, and a deep understanding of these constructs can provide insights into how society and the world truly function.

One initial proof that will be provided is the concept of ordered adjectives. While not explicitly taught in formal education, there is a subconscious understanding of the correct order of adjectives in the English language. For example, saying "a fast red car" sounds natural, while "a red fast car" sounds odd. This unspoken agreement on adjective order exists among the majority of English speakers, even though they have never been explicitly taught the order.

Based on the proof of ordered adjectives, it is conjectured that there are other constructs within society that remain largely unnoticed. One such construct that the author is intimately familiar with is body language and nonverbal communication. Individuals with conditions such as ADHD or autism may have limited ability to recognize or interpret nonverbal cues. This suggests that there is an entire language construct that a significant portion of the population is missing out on.

So they published a very, very small study, a preliminary sort of report, in a journal called medical hypothesis, and then started on another study, found that the same person will perform differently on certain tests Depending on whether they are male or female, for example. She gave the same person these mental puzzles test spatial and language abilities. And , you know, men are really good at, supposedly, men are really good at kind of spatial directions spatial manipulation? take a geometric shape rotated in your mind, stuff like that. They found, they gave these tests to these people when they were in their different states, they had different abilities. So when they were men, they performed more as men, and when they were women, they performed more as women.

The purpose of this project is to delve into various sources, including history, literature, art, song lyrics, biographies, and even works of fiction, in search of records or indications of individuals who have understood and documented these unseen constructs. The ideal scenario would be finding someone who has already figured out these constructs and recorded their findings. However, if such records are not found, the next best approach is to analyze the creative works and notations of a large group of individuals who seem to have an inherent understanding of the underlying workings of the world.

Through a thorough collection and analysis of the writings and works of these individuals, the project aims to define and pin down the shape and order of these unseen constructs. It is firmly believed that such individuals exist, and the project has already identified several potential candidates who, through their works and observations of life, seem to possess an inherent understanding of these hidden aspects.

In conclusion, this project seeks to uncover and understand the unseen constructs of society. By exploring various sources and analyzing the works of individuals who seem to possess a deep understanding of these constructs, it is hoped that a comprehensive understanding of these hidden aspects can be achieved.

The notion that blindness is a social construction challenges our common understanding of visual impairment as simply a physical limitation. This perspective, originating from Bob Scott, a Princeton sociology professor, suggests that the way society is structured and how we collectively think about blindness significantly shapes the experience of being blind.

Framing blindness as a social construction means recognizing that many of the challenges faced by blind individuals arise not just from the lack of sight itself, but also from living in a world primarily designed for and by the sighted. Societal assumptions, expectations, and the built environment all contribute to defining what blindness means and how it is experienced.

This idea encourages us to think critically about disability and how social factors can enable or constrain individuals. It shifts focus from just the physical condition to the interaction between individuals and their social context. By understanding the role society plays in constructing the experience of blindness, we can work towards creating more inclusive environments that empower and support those with visual impairments.

Society often assumes that certain tasks or roles are impossible for people with specific impairments, without considering their individual skills, adaptability, and potential accommodations that could be made.
