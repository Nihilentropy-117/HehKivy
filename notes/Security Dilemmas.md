In general, all of history is a series of people saying, well, we need to pursue this truly grotesque mission because if we don't, the enemy will, or we suspect they already are. the only reason the enemy is doing it is because they think you're doing it. I'm sure there's a name for that paradox.

here you can see this weird game theory thing where unchecked paranoia about your enemy is a blank check to your people to just pursue madness.

1. **Security Dilemma**: This is a term from international relations theory which describes a situation where one state's attempts to secure itself (for example, by amassing weapons) causes other states to feel insecure. This in turn leads them to build up their own military capabilities, leading to an arms race that makes all involved less secure than they were to begin with.

2. Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)**: This Cold War-era doctrine posited that nuclear war could be prevented if both the United States and the Soviet Union had sufficient nuclear capabilities to destroy each other, thereby deterring either from launching a first strike.

3. Prisoner's Dilemma: This is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so. Each player suspects the other will betray them, leading both to act in a way that is mutually detrimental.

4. **Arms Race**: This term describes a competition between two or more states to have superior armed forces. Each party is driven to outdo the others in fear of being overtaken or attacked.

5. Zero-Sum Game: In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants.

All of these concepts touch on the idea of a negative feedback loop driven by fear, mistrust, or competition, where actions taken by one party lead to reactions by others that ultimately harm everyone involved.
