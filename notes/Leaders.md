Most people have an astounding ability to detect bullshit.

That's why you don't lead by being loud.

You don't lead by being the tallest or the bossiest.

Although sometimes I think those are the traits that people look for in a leader because they think that a leader needs to be "good at leading".

But it goes back to the Douglas Adams quote about the best person to rule the galaxy is not the person that wants to rule the galaxy.

>>"The major problem—one of the major problems, for there are several—one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather, who manages to get people to let them do it to them. To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job."

The best trait to have in a good leader is someone who is good at the fucking thing they're trying to lead or at least understands how to delegate that part to people who are good at it themselves and guide those people. It's not about having all the answers but knowing where to find them and how to mobilize and motivate a team of skilled individuals towards a common goal.

This requires a deep understanding of the domain, the tasks at hand, and the dynamics of the team. People are often incredibly good, at having an inherent detection for bullshit in the people in charge of them.

When you've been doing a job for so long and you've learned all of the ins and outs and intricacies of the experience and someone new comes in that doesn't know what they're doing, you can tell immediately.

True leadership is about authenticity, competence, and the ability to foster a collaborative environment where each team member's strengths are recognized and utilized. Such leaders inspire trust and respect, not through imposing their will or showcasing superficial qualities, but through their genuine commitment to the team's success and their competence in guiding that journey.
